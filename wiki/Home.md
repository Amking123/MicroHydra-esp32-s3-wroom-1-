Welcome to the MicroHydra wiki!

This program includes a few libraries that can help you quickly get a new app up and running. Your apps are free to add and import any libraries not listed here, but this is what comes with MicroHydra itself.

For any developers using MicroPython but not MicroHydra, feel free to take the files from /lib/ and use them for your own purposes.   
*(Of course, just make sure you respect that file's license.)*
